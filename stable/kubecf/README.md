# KubeCF

KubeCF is a Cloud Foundry distribution for Kubernetes. KubeCF installs BOSH releases from
cf-deployment as Kubernetes objects. It includes all components required for a full Cloud Foundry
Application Runtime (CFAR) PaaS on Kubernetes.


## Install the Quarks operator

This chart depends on the [Quarks operator][1], which must be installed before KubeCF to provide
Kubernetes CRDs necessary for running some components.

Each KubeCF release is paired with a specific Quarks release. Check the [KubeCF Release Notes][2] to
see which version you need. 


## Requirements 

KubeCF can be deployed to Kubernetes 1.14 or later with a persistent storage class.  


## Configuration

The complete list of settings can be seen in `values.yaml` file of this chart, but *do not* copy
this file verbatim as a starting point for your custom configuration. Some of the values are set to
provide defaults to sub-charts and are subject to change in future releases, which may break
upgrades if you reuse them in your own `values.yaml`.

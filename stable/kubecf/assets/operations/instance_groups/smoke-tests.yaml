# The smoke-tests require the cf-cli package that is provided by the cf-cli-7-linux job from another
# BOSH release. Since the /var/vcap/packages directory is not shared between the containers of different
# releases, smoke-tests won't have access # to the cf-cli package. 
# As part of the pre-render scripts added here will patch the cf-cli-7-linux
# job in order to add a BOSH pre-start script. This script will then copy the cf-cli package into a
# shared volume that can be accessed by the smoke-tests job.

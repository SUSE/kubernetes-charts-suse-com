    # This patch changes the BPM command to not use spec.ip because the
    # quarks-operator implements process management very differently from
    # BOSH: BPM is rendered from a completely different container (and
    # therefore has no chance of having a valid spec.ip).
    #
    # We have no idea how we can implement the change in an upstream-
    # compatible way: we hack around things by changing the POD_IP
    # environment variable via an ops file [1], which wouldn't make any
    # sense in the BOSH VM world.
    #
    # [1] chart/assets/operations/instance_groups/routing-api.yaml
    #
    # Result: The patch is extremely specific to kubecf, and cannot be
    # upstreamed.

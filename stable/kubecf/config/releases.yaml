  : >
    The "release.defaults" setting is now "releases.$defaults", but most
    likely the presence of release defaults in your config is an error
    based on using the whole "values.yaml" files from an earlier release
    as your local config file.

  ? releases.pxc.image
  : >
    The native 'pxc' release has been renamed to 'database' to avoid a
    naming conflict with the bosh release of pxc.

# SUSE Private Registry powered by Harbor - Cloud Native Repository for Kubernetes

[Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor) is an open source registry that secures artifacts with policies and role-based access control, ensures images are scanned and free from vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted. Harbor, a CNCF Graduated project, delivers compliance, performance, and interoperability to help you consistently and securely manage artifacts across cloud native compute platforms like Kubernetes and Docker.

This [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) chart installs [SUSE Private Registry](https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all/html/SBP-Private-Registry/index.html) in a Kubernetes cluster.
